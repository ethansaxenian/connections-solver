This program tries its best to solve connections.


## Setup
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The first time you run `python3 connections.py`, it will download an archive of word vectors to the `~/gensim-data` directory. You can safely delete this folder.
